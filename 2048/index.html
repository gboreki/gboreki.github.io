      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>This page is based on an experiment with my daughter on the ability of creating a 2048 clone using chatgpt. The entire premise was to try to write as little code as possible, and attempt to prompt chatgpt to give the next steps. </p>
      <p>We decided to add a logo which was created by prompting MidJourney AI for an image of a chihuahua in a style similar to artist Romero Britto. 
      <p>Check out the resulting game <a href="game.html">Here</a></p>

      <h2>Gameplay</h2>
      <p>To start the game, the player is presented with two tiles, each with the number 2 on them. The player can slide the tiles in any of the four directions: up, down, left, or right. When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile with the sum of the two numbers.</p>
      <p>The player can continue to slide tiles around the board, trying to create tiles with larger and larger numbers. The game ends when the player creates a tile with the number 2048, or when the board is completely filled with tiles and there are no more moves to make.</p>

      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>There are a few key strategies that can help players achieve high scores in 2048. One strategy is to keep the largest numbers in the corners of the board, where they are less likely to get in the way of other tiles. Another strategy is to try to create "chains" of tiles with the same numbers, which can be merged into even larger tiles. Players should also try to keep the board as open as possible, by avoiding moves that create unnecessary tiles in the middle of the board.</p>
