  3. Match including power-up block
  4. Adjacent same-colored blocks should change
  5. Verify chain reactions work

- [ ] Time Slow Power-up
  - Temporarily reduces piece fall speed (5 seconds)
  - Visual indicator for slow effect
  - Duration management
  Verification:
  1. Press 'T' to spawn time slow power-up
  2. Middle block should be green with pulse
  3. Match including power-up block
  4. Fall speed should reduce for 5 seconds
  5. Visual timer should show duration

- [ ] Block Breaker Power-up
  - Destroys blocks in a specific pattern
  - Multiple pattern options
  - Combo potential with other power-ups
