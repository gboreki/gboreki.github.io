# Project Tasks - Columns Game Implementation

## 1. Core Game Components ✅
- [x] Create basic HTML structure
  - Game board container (20x10 grid)
  - Score display
  - Next piece preview area
  - Game over/pause overlay

- [x] Game Board Class
  - Grid representation (2D array)
  - Methods for checking cell states
  - Methods for locking pieces
  - Methods for clearing matched colors

- [x] Piece Class
  - Properties: position, colors, state
  - Methods for rotation (up/down)
  - Methods for movement (left/right)
  - Collision detection

## 2. Game Mechanics ✅
- [x] Piece Generation
  - Random color assignment
  - Preview system
  - Spawn position logic

- [x] Movement System
  - Gravity/falling mechanics
  - Left/right movement
  - Rotation logic
  - Soft drop implementation

- [x] Match Detection
  - Horizontal match checking
  - Vertical match checking
  - Score calculation
  - Cell clearing

## 3. Game Control Systems ✅
- [x] Input Handler
  - Keyboard event listeners
  - Arrow key controls
  - Space bar handling
  - Escape key (pause) handling
  - Touch controls for mobile

- [x] Game Loop
  - Main update cycle
  - Speed management
  - Difficulty progression
  - Game state management (playing, paused, game over)

## 4. Visual and UI Elements ✅
- [x] Styling
  - Grid cell styling
  - Piece colors
  - Preview area design
  - Score display
  - Cell clearing animation

- [x] Game State UI
  - Pause screen
  - Game over screen
  - Score display
  - Speed level indicator

## 5. Game Flow Management ✅
- [x] Speed Progression
  - Points tracking
  - Speed adjustment every 10 lines
  - Minimum speed limit (100ms)
  - Level up animations

- [x] State Management
  - Game initialization
  - Pause/resume logic
  - Game over conditions
  - Reset functionality
  - High score system

## Implementation Order
1. Basic HTML/CSS structure
2. Core game board and piece classes
3. Basic movement and gravity
4. Input handling
5. Collision detection
6. Match detection and scoring
7. Game loop and speed progression
8. UI elements and state management
9. Polish and bug fixes

## Technical Considerations
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation
- Implement separate update and render loops
- Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for game board layout
- Consider using a state machine for game states
- Implement proper collision detection before rotation logic
